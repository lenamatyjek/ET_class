Basic Research Methods: Eye tracking

Download all materials with the "Clone of download" button. If you use git, you can also clone the repository.

Slides from the lecture can be found under:
- lecture_slides.pdf

Slides from the tutorial can be found under:
- Tutorial_slides.pdf (won't display well, rather use the next option)
- Tutorial_slides.html (just open in your browser. No need for Internet connection)
- Tutorial_slides.Rmd (this is the code for the slides)

Tutorial_slides.Rmd should be considered the main file for the tutorial materials. It loads data from the data folder and creates slides in pdf and html. To use it, open the file in Rstudio (make sure you have R language installed on your machine), and click "Knit". This will produce the output files. You can also run all the lines of the code one-by-be (ctrl+enter) or by chunks (ctrl+shift+enter).
